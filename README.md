A 45x42mm breakout board for the [Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html). It features a tonne of `3V` and `GND` pins, as well as 3 header pins for SPI connections. There are smaller more concise breakouts, but I needed something that placed the Teensy's USB port at the top, with 4 decent sized mount points.
